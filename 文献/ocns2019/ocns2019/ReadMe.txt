Abstract:
    Context. Developing high-precision ephemerides for Neptunian satellites requires not only the continuation of observing campaign but also the collection and improvements of existing observations. So far, no complete catalogs of observations of Neptunian satellites are available.
    
	Aims. The goals are to provide new precise positions, and to compile a catalog including all available ground-based astrometric observations of Neptunian satellites. The observations are tabulated in a single and consistent format and given in the same time scale (TT) and reference system (ICRS), including necessary changes and corrections.
    
	Methods. On one hand, new CCD observations of Triton and Nereid are made at Lijiang 2.4-m and Yaoan 0.8-m telescopes in 2013–2019, and then reduced based on Gaia-DR2. On the other hand, a catalog called OCNS2019 (Observational Catalog of Neptunian Satellites (2019 version)) is compiled, after recognizing and correcting errors and omissions. Furthermore, in addition to what have been considered for the COSS09 catalog for eight main Saturnian satellites, all observed absolute and relative coordinates are converted to the ICRS, with corrections for star catalog biases with respect to Gaia-DR2. New debiasing tables for both the modern and old star catalogs previously not given based on Gaia-DR2 are developed and applied. Treatment of missing positions of comparison bodies in conversions of observed relative coordinates are proposed.
    
	Results. OCNS2019 and the new debiasing tables are publicly available online. OCNS2019 includes 24996 observed coordinates of 11 Neptunian satellites obtained in 3741 nights from 1847 to 2019. All observations are given in TT and ICRS. The star catalog biases are removed, which are significant for Nereid and outer satellites. Among all the observed coordinates of Triton, 880 (5%) obtained in 41 nights (1%) are our new ones, and, of Nereid, 790 (14%) in 47 nights (10%). The precision of these new positions is about 0".03 for Triton and 0".06 for Nereid.
    
	Conclusions. OCNS2019 should be useful in improving ephemerides for the above mentioned objects.
