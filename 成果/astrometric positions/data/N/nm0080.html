Comments
   Observations from  1 to  7 were taken from [1]
   Observations from  8 to 58 were taken from [2]
   Observations from 59 to 60 were taken from [3]
   The observations before 28.09.1899 given in [1] were ignored since they had been added to the NSDB earlier (see <A HREF="http://www.sai.msu.ru/neb/nss/OBS_COLL/N/nm0058.txt">nm0058.txt</A>)
   Most observations from [3] were also ignored by the same reason (see <A HREF="http://www.sai.msu.ru/neb/nss/OBS_COLL/N/nm0040.txt">nm0040.txt</A>)
