            Abstract:
            Astrometric photographic positions of the Saturnian
            satellite Helene obtained from 22 plates taken in 6
            nights are presented. The observations are distributed
            between 5 missions in 1985 and 1987. All positions are
            compared with those calculated by Jacobson (1999,
            personal communication). The residuals have mean and
            standard deviation smaller than 0.25" and 0.30"
            respectively.
          evaluation: The differences  O-C(X), O-C(Y) are published
                      in the article. For these values one have:
                                                     X        Y
                      M. (mean)                    0.178"   -0.101"
                      R.M.S. (root mean square)    0.434"    0.250"
                      The differences  O-C(X)e, O-C(Y)e were also
                      calculated by N.Emelianov with the theory by
                      P. Oberty for Helene and with the theory by
                      Harper & Taylor for Titan.
                      With these O-C one have
                                                     X        Y
                      M. (mean)                   -0.087"   -0.181"
                      R.M.S. (root mean square)    0.470"    0.536"
