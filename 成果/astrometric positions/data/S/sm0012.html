Comments.
          evaluation: The differences  O-C(X), O-C(Y) are published
                      in the article. For these values one have (the 5
                      positions with gross errors were excluded):
                                                     X        Y
                      M. (mean)                    0.061"   -0.199"
                      R.M.S. (root mean square)    0.316"    0.385"
                      The differences  O-C(X)e, O-C(Y)e were also
                      calculated by N.Emelianov with the theory by
                      Harper & Taylor.
                      With these O-C one have
                                                     X        Y
                      M. (mean)                    0.019"   -0.175"
                      R.M.S. (root mean square)    0.161"    0.300"
