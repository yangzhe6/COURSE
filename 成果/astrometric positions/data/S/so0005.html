Comments.
 The pixels were 0.33 arcsec and the CCD chip size 330 arcsec on 
 the side.  A red (R) filter was used and the exposure was 64 sec.  
 It is straightforward to measure the position of Phoebe and about 
 ten reference stars on each exposure.  The positions of the 
 reference stars were measured on the Digital Sky Survey (DSS-II 
 with 1 arcsec pixels) together with about ten stars from the USNO 
 ACT catalogue, all within 0.7 degrees of the CCD fields.   The 
 goodness of fit was 0.12 arcsec, rms in one co-ordinate.
    The goodness of fit of the reference stars to the positions 
 measured on the CCD was smaller.  Phoebe was measured relative to 
 the same reference stars within each night but relative to a 
 different set of reference stars on different nights.   The 
 scatter of the residuals relative to the JPL Horizons ephemeris 
 within nights was much smaller than from night to night.   This 
 indicates that the accuracy is simply the accuracy of the star 
 positions, i.e. 0.12 arcsec.
    The observations have been combined into one normal place for 
 each of the seven nights with an rms scatter of 0.04 arcsec 
 within nights.
