Comments.
    We used the USNO A2 catalogue
    of stars for the astrometric reduction. With the help
    of observations of optical counterparts of ICRF sources, a zonal
    correction to the USNO A2.0 catalogue was computed and applied to the
    Phoebe positions.
    Topocentric ICRF J2000 Phoebe positions reduced from CCD observations
    realised with the 1.2m of the OHP Observatory. The positions proposed
    in the following table is corrected from a systematic effect
    introduced by the USNO A2.0 reference stars. This correction was
    estimated after ICRF optical counterparts observations (Fienga and
    Andrei, 2002, A&A, submitted)

    Some observations published by Fienga et al. were excluded since they were later refined and republished in Gomes-Junior A. R. et al. (2015)
