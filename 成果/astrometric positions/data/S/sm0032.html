Comments.
          evaluation: The differences  O-C(alpha)e, O-C(delta)e were
                      calculated by N.Emelianov with the theory by
                      Harper & Taylor. One positions with gross
                      errors were excluded.
                      With these O-C one have
                                                   alpha    delta
                      M. (mean)                   -0.030"  -0.076"
                      R.M.S. (root mean square)    0.670"   0.432"
