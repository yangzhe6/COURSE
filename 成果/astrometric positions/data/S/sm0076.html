Informations.
           relative to: some reference line with given celestial position
       reference frame: astrometric
       center of frame: geocentre
      epoch of equinox: ICRS/J2000.0
            time scale: TT
             reduction: corrections for stellar aberration, the general relativistic gravitational light bending due to the Sun's gravitational field,
                        and Hipparcos satellite's parallax
           coordinates: unspecified position of the satellite on the reference line passing through the reference point with given absolute coordinates,
                        position angle of a line normal to the reference line relative to the reference point
      diff. refraction: not given
              receptor: image dissector tube
             telescope: all-reflective Schmidt telescope with the mirror combining two fields of view (0.9 x 0.9 deg) separated by 58 deg,
                        D/F=290/1400 mm
             observers: the data were analyzed by NDAC (Northern Data Analysis Consortium) and FAST (Fundamental Astronomy by Space Techniques) consortia
data included in standard data file: no

Comments.
  Some observations of Iapetus were analyzed by both NDAC and FAST consortia so that from 13 observations of Iapetus only 8 are unique.

Format.
  1. Satellite number, N (904 - Titan, 905 - Iapetus)
  2. Right ascension of the reference point with decimals (alpha, deg)
  3. Declination of the reference point with decimals (delta, deg)
  4. Measurement epoch, corrected to the geocentre, with respect to JD 2440000.0 (epoch)
  5. Light time delay between Hipparcos and geocentre along the astrometric direction from geocentre to the observed object (dtau, seconds)
  6. Position angle (relative to the reference point) of the line normal to that on which the satellite is situated (P, deg). To get position angle
     of the satellite relative to the reference point, it is necessary to add 90 degrees to this value
  7. Standard error of the satellite's position along the direction normal to the line on which the satellite is situated (sigma, mas)
  8. Consortium that analyzed the data, C (1 - NDAC, 2 - FAST)
