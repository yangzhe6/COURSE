Comments.

Format.
 In a FORTRAN code, one line is read with the format:
 (i3,i5,i3,f11.7,f7.3,2i4,i2,1x,a2,a1,i2,i1,
 2(1x,f13.7),2i2,2(1x,f7.3),3i3,2f10.3)
 The meanings of each parameter can be found in (Strugnell & Taylor
 1990), but we recall them below with eventually, in parenthesis,
 the differences with the original meaning:
 * opp: opposition number, 1=1874 to 118=1995.
 * year,m,utc: year, month and utc date of the observation (one more
   digit for utc: f11.7)
 * tt-utc: TT-UTC in seconds (two more digits: f7.3)
 * obs: UAI observatory code from the Minor Planet Center,
 * ref: reference code of the catalog (we have chosen 301 for the present
   observations)
 * t.: observation type.
   0=\alpha, \delta,
   1=\Delta \alpha \cos \delta, \Delta \delta,
   2=\Delta \alpha,\Delta \delta,
   3=position angle, separation
 * obj.: subject satellite, reference satellite. 0 for Saturn, 1 to
   8 for S1 to S8 (* when there is no reference satellite that is for
   observation type 0 , C for the center of the plate which is not
   a physical object)
 * fl.: flags of presence of the first and second coordinates
 * obs1, obs2 : first and second coordinates (one more digit, it is
   0 when the coordinate is not present, see fl.)
 * s: reference system. 0=mean equator and equinox B1950, 1=true equator
   and equinox of date of observation, 2=mean equator and equinox of
   J2000
 * f: reference frame. 0=topocentric, 1=geocentric, 2=heliocentric
 * o-c1, o-c2: residuals of observations in arc-seconds (computed with
   TASS1.7 and with the format f7.3, it is 999.999 when the residuals
   are not computed and it is 888.888 when the residuals are greater
   than 100. in absolute value).
 * (r: the number of the satellite used as reference in the computation
   of o-c)
 * (-: no meaning in this series, index reserved)
 * (s: the number of the series, the scale and orientation are the same
   for all the observations of one series).
 * (xpix,ypix: original coordinates in pixels)
