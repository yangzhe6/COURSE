           observers: Peng Q., Vienne A., Shen K.X. 
 data included in standard data file: no

Comments.
    The calibrated parameters of the CCD scale and orientation are 
    determined by the comparison of their measurement coordinates 
    with computed positions of four bright satellites of 
    Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Titan.
    Analysis of
    the data as inter-satellite positions shows that these observations of
    the above mentioned four satellites have root-mean-square residuals of
    0.04 arcsec in the sense of (O-C) (Observed minus Computed).
