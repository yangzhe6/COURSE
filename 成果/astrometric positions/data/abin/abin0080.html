Informations.
       relative to: the primary
    eference frame: astrometric ICRF 
   centre of frame: topocentric 
  epoch of equinox: J2000 
        time scale: UTC 
         reduction: no information
       coordinates: Delta(RA), Delta(Decl) (secondary relative to primary) 
  diff. refraction: no information 
          receptor: 
         telescope: 1 - 8.3-m Subaru telescope, Mauna Kea 
                    2 - 8.1-m Gemini North telescope, Mauna Kea
                    3 - 8.1-m Gemini South telescope of Gemini South Observatory
                    4 - Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope 
  
Comments. 1. The relative coordinates are mentioned as Delta(RA), Delta(Decl). 
          2. GMOS (Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs) on Gemini South was used for the 2007 
             to early 2008 DDT observations.
             GMOS on Gemini North was used for the later 2008 through 2011 observations.
          3. All data is from Gemini except the October 14th 2007 discovery data from Subaru 
             and the September 20th 2008 observations from HST by Noll et al.(2009). 
          4. The m is the difference in magnitude between the two components. 
          5. On February 9, 2010 the individual binary components were not resolved and 
             thus zero was chosen for the offset.                                                       

Format. 
                                      
 1. Year of the moment of observation 
 2. Month of the moment of observation  
 3. Day of the moment of observation with decimals
 4. Delta(RA) - relative right ascension, arcsec
 5. SigX - the error of Delta(RA) (1-sigma uncertainties), arcsec
 6. Delta(Decl) - relative declination, arcsec 
 7. SigY - the error of Delta(Decl), arcsec
 8. m - relative magnitude (99.99 means no data)
 9. Sig m - the error of m (99.99 means no data)
10. Ntel - number of telescope 
11. Code - code of observatory
