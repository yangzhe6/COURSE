Comments.
  The observations of presumed satellite of (4337) Arecibo were reduced from two occultation events. The first event
  was occultation of the star UCAC4 323-126197 observed at Kuriwa Observatory and Hazelbrook. The second event was
  occultation of the star UCAC4 322-116848 observed at San Ardo (CA, USA) and Bradley (CA, USA). Positions of presumed
  satellite were obtained on the assumption that the bodies presented a circular profile.

Format.
