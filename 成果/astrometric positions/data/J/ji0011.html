Comments.
        1. These observations of Amalthea made by Van Biesbroeck G.
           were corrected and reduced to the mean equinox of date
           by Sudbury P. V. (1969).
        1. Satellite was referred to three astrographic stars of the
           Paris zone for which improved plate constants are now 
           available (Heckmann et al. 1954)
        2. The observed coordinates of Jupiter from the ephemeris
           are also published by Sudbury P. V. (1969).
