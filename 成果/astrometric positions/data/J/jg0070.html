mutual eclipse and occultation between Europa and Ganymede 
on 22 August 2021.
Icarus. 2022. P. 115348.

Informations.
         relative to: reference body is an occulted or eclipsed satellite:
                      J2 - Europa   :  2,
     reference frame: astrometric
     centre of frame: topocenter for 3o2 event, heliocenter for 3e2 event
    epoch of equinox: J2000
          time scale: UTC
           reduction: from mutual occultations and eclipses
         coordinates: X, Y
    diff. refraction: not applicable
            receptor: photometric (see the relevant article)
           telescope: See in the publication
           observers: See in the publication
 data included in standard data file : no

Comments.
     Note that for 3o2 event the relative topocentric coordinates are given and
     for 3e2 event the relative heliocentric coordinates are given.
     Data are deduced from the photometric observations
     of the quasi-simultaneous  mutual eclipse and occultation 
     between Europa and Ganymede on 22 August 2021.
     
Format.
  1. The type of the phenomenon (eclipse or occultation) including the
     satellite numbers. The type of phenomenon is coded as n_a o n_p 
     or n_a e n_p for a mutual occultation or eclipse, respectively.
     Here $n_a$ is the number of the occulting or eclipsing satellite 
     and $n_p$ is the number of the occulted or eclipsed satellite.
  2. Year of observation
  3. Month of observation
  4. Day of observation with decimals
  5. X, arcsec
  6. Y, arcsec
