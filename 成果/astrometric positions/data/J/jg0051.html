Comments.
    The technique of mutual approximations accurately gives the central instant 
    at the maximum apparent approximation of two moving natural satellites in the sky plane.
    Observatory coordinates:
    OPD: 45 deg 34' 57.5'' W   22 deg 32' 07.8'' S   Alt 1864 m

Format.
  1. Year of the Central Instant of Mutual approximation
  2. Month of the Central Instant of Mutual approximation
  3. Day of the Central Instant of Mutual approximation
  4. Hour of the Central Instant of Mutual approximation (UTC)
  5. Minute of the Central Instant of Mutual approximation (UTC)
  6. Seconds of the Central Instant of Mutual approximation (UTC)
  7. Sat1, number of the first satellite in the pair of the Mutual approximation 
  8. Sat2, number of the second satellite in the pair of the Mutual approximation 
  9. sigma t0, the central instant error in seconds of time
 10. sigma t0, the central instant error in mas 
     (using the relative velocity in each event obtained with the ephemeris}
