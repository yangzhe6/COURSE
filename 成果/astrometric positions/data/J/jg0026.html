Informations.
         relative to: reference body is an occulted or eclipsed satellite.
     reference frame: astrometric
     centre of frame: topocenter for mutual occultation
                      or heliocenter for mutual eclipse
    epoch of equinox: J2000
          time scale: UTC
           reduction: from mutual occultations and eclipses
         coordinates: Position angle (topocentric for mutual occultation
                      or heliocentric for mutual eclipse)
    diff. refraction: no information
            receptor: photometric (see the relevant article)
           telescope: See in the publication
           observers: See in the publication
 data included in standard data file: no

Comments.
     Data are deduced from the photometric observations
     of the mutual occultations and eclipses made during
     the international campaign in 1997.
     The description of these astrometric data is given 
     in the relevant article (see Reference).
     The apparent relative position of the satellite measured 
     across the apparent trajectory can not be determined accurately enough 
     and therefore position angles can be determined only up to 180 deg (+/- 180 deg).
     The second group of the data is presented in this item.
     The "O-C' are given with respect of the theory by V.Lainey
     (Lainey, V., Arlot, J. E., Vienne, A. 2004, A&A, 427, 371).
     The first group of the data see in the following item jg0025 of the NSDC.
     The coordinates of the observatories can be found in
     (Arlot J.-E., Thuillot W., Ruatti C. and 61 co-autors. A&A, 2006, 451, 733-737) 
     Correspondence between the Observatory code in these data 
     and the observatory name in the paper (Arlot et al, 2006) is following

Format.
  1. Year of observation
  2. Month of observation
  3. Day of observation
  4. The type of the phenomenon (eclipse or occultation) including the
     satellite numbers. The type of phenomenon is coded as n_a o n_p 
     or n_a e n_p for a mutual occultation or eclipse, respectively.
     Here n_a is the number of the occulting or eclipsing satellite 
     and n_p is the number of the occulted or eclipsed satellite.
  5. Observatory code (see the table in the relevant article).
  6. Hour of the astrometric data (UTC)
  7. Minute of the astrometric data (UTC)
  8. Seconde of the astrometric data with decimals (UTC)
  9. Position angle A in degrees (topocentric for mutual occultation
                                or heliocentric for mutual eclipse)
 10. Precision of apparent position along the apparent relative trajectory 
     of the satellite as obtained with the least-square method, in arcseconds
 11. Flag R assigned showing the reason why only one coordinate was determined: 
     ’0’ for a total mutual eclipse or occultation observed, 
     ’1’ for the results obtained from poor photometric data
