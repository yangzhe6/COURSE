Comments.
    These are reduced positions from CCD observations
    of three of the outer Jovian satellites, taken on three nights
    in the past three years.  (Our observing time is limited,
    and these satellites seem to avoid areas of the sky with
    good reference stars.)  The detector is a 4K x 4K CCD,
    15 um/pixel, with 1 pixel subtending 0.32 arcsec and the entire
    field of view about 22 arcmin.
    The observations were reduced to the ACT catalog using Eichhorn's
    overlapping plate method.  They are reported below in the format
    used by the MPC.

Format.
  1. Number of satellite (N sat)
  2. Year   of the moment of observation
  3. Month  of the moment of observation
  4. Day with decimals of the moment of observation
  5. Hour   of right ascension (alpha, h)
  6. Minute of right ascension (alpha, m)
  7. Second of right ascension (alpha, s)
  8. Degree of declination (delta, deg)
  9. Minute of declination (delta, '  )
 10. Second of declination (delta, '' )
