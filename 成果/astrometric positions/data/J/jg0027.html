Comments.
     Data are deduced from the photometric observations
     of the mutual occultations and eclipses made during
     the international campaign in 2002-2003.
     The description of these astrometric data and
     the coordinates of the observatories are given 
     in the relevant article (see Reference).
     The first group of the data is presented in this item.
     The "O-C' are given with respect of the theory by V.Lainey
     (Lainey, V., Arlot, J. E., Vienne, A. 2004, A&A, 427, 371).
     The second group of the data see in the following item jg0028 of the NSDC.
         
Format.
  1. Year of observation
  2. Month of observation
  3. Day of observation
  4. The type of the phenomenon (eclipse or occultation) including the
     satellite numbers. The type of phenomenon is coded as n_a o n_p 
     or n_a e n_p for a mutual occultation or eclipse, respectively.
     Here $n_a$ is the number of the occulting or eclipsing satellite 
     and $n_p$ is the number of the occulted or eclipsed satellite.
  5. Observatory code (see the table in the relevant article).
  6. Hour of the astrometric data (UTC)
  7. Minute of the astrometric data (UTC)
  8. Seconde of the astrometric data with decimals (UTC)
  9. X coordinate in arcseconds (topocentric for mutual occultation
                                or heliocentric for mutual eclipse)
 10. Y coordinate in arcseconds (topocentric for mutual occultation
                                or heliocentric for mutual eclipse)
 11. sigma of X in arcseconds
 12. sigma of Y in arcseconds
 13. "O-C" for X in arcseconds
 14. "O-C" for Y in arcseconds
 15. Angular separation s (in arcseconds) corresponding to X, Y.
 16. Position angle A (in degrees) corresponding to X, Y.
 17. Flag Q indicating the quality and the reliability of the result:
    '0'  for normally determined coordinates,
    '1'  for the cases where the result of the observations
         at the given observatory differs considerably from the results
         of other observatories, 
    '2'  for the results obtained from poor photometric data.
 18. The minimum level S min of normalized flux.
