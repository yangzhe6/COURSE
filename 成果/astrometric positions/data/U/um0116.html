 data included in standard data file: no

Comments.
   The center of mass of satellite images is defined in condition
   that the sum of X coorditates of all satellites which are present 
   on the picture is equal to zero. And similary for Y coordinates. 
   Note that two pictures contain on 5 satellites and
   five pictures contain on 4 satellites.
      The Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and USNO-B1.0
   were used as reference catalogues.
      The DE405 (Standish 1998) and INPOP (Fienga et al. 2008) planetary theories 
   and the GUST86 (Laskar & Jacobson 1987) and GUST06 (Emelyanov et al. 2006) 
   satellite theories were applied to compute the O-C (see article).
   The satellites' positions obtained with respect to 2MASS are
   in better agreement with theories than the coordinates of the
   satellites determined with respect to USNO-B1.0.
