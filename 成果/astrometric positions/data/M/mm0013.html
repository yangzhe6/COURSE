                  0 - not corrected or no information
                  1 - corrected for phase,
                  2 - corrected for differential refraction
                  3 - both 1 and 2
 Notes:
 Note 1. The units for the observations are seconds of arc except for
         position angle when the unit is degrees east of north in the
         range 0 - 360.
 Note 2. The units for the observation noise are always seconds of arc.
         For a position angle p, the noise refers to the product of the
         error in p and the separation angle.
 Note 3. In the ESOC system, when the noise is greater or equal to 99.0
         the corresponding observation is of bad quality and is not used
         in the determination of the orbit but its residual is computed
         and printed.
 Note 4. When the observation is either Delta a or Delta d the columns
         normally used for the complementary observation are used to
         store the position angle, theta. Also, the columns normally
         used to store the noise of thre complementary observation
         contain 0.0.
