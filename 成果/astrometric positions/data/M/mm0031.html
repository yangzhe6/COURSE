Comments.
  1. Mars Express positions at SRC image mid-times were retrieved from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) navigation orbits.
     See also the <a href="mm0032.html">data</a> based on Mars Express positions generated at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC). 
  2. A total of 158 astrometric observations of Phobos have been made. From these, 27 were determined by using only control point measurements,
     28 performing only limb fit observations, and 103 were determined by means of both methods. Hence, data table contains 261 entries,
     that is 130 control point measurements and 131 limb fit observations.

Format.
