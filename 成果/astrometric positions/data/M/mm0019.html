Comments.
 The catalogue of astrometric positions of Mars, Phobos and Deimos
 V.Golovnya, E.Izhakevich, I.Ledovskaya, S.Major, S.Shatokhina
 The catalogue of the photographic positions of Mars, Phobos and Deimos contains
 geocentric positions of Mars ( 942 positions), Phobos (133) and Deimos (283).
 The observations of Mars and its satellites were made with the 400/5500 double
 long-focus astrograph at Golosiiv, the 600-mm Zeiss reflector at Majdanak, the
 400/3000 double wide-angle astrograph at Kitab over the period from 1963 to
 1988.
 The different sets of these observations were originally reduced to the Yale,
 AGK3, SAO, FOCAT, H* catalogues and published by different authors. These
 positions were collected, reviewed and rereduced to ACT and PPM reference
 systems with the aid of either published dependences for the reference stars or
 measured rectangular coordinates. All positions were compared with the JPL
 ephemeris.
 * - the catalogue of the faint stars around Mars for 1988 opposition made by
 H.Potter.
 This data base contains the positions of Phobos and Deimos.
 The positions of Mars were included also to be able to obtain
 the relative positions of the satellites.
